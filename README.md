# Raiden

Raiden is a web application built with Next.js, leveraging TypeScript and Tailwind CSS to create a responsive and scalable user interface. Raiden's main purpose is to listen to webhooks from Zapier and store them into a SCRUM table. This project was originally created to help marketplaces to organize their webhooks and customer events without the need of paying for a expensive platform.
